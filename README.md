# OpenPRD Examples

This repository contains examples of resumes formatted using the Open Portable Resume Document (OpenPRD) protocol. OpenPRD uses microdata to tag and structure data in resumes, making it easily retrievable and manageable for employers and hiring managers.

## Examples

Each example includes a resume file in the OpenPRD .prd or .prx format and a JSON file that displays the resume data as would be pulled with a prd reading script.

Here are some of the examples that will be included in this repository:

- `basic-resume`: This example includes a basic resume with sections for contact information, education, work experience, and skills.
- `developer-resume`: This example includes a resume for a software developer with additional sections for programming languages, tools, and projects.
- `designer-resume`: This example includes a resume for a graphic designer with additional sections for design skills, software experience, and design projects.

## Contributing

This repository is open to contributions from anyone who wants to provide additional examples or improve existing ones. To contribute, simply fork this repository and submit a pull request with your changes.
